# SH2ModLoader
A Mod Loader for Soul Hackers 2, made using [BepInEx](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx).
## Features
- Ability to load modified asset bundles from a `mods` directory instead of directly modifying the original ones
- Log which asset bundles are being accessed at any specific time
## How to install
Follow the guide in the [INSTALL.md](https://github.com/shujynx/SH2ModLoader/blob/main/INSTALL.md)
## Known Issues / To-Dos
- Currently the Mod Loader only supports loading modified Asset Bundles, work on being able to load modified acb/awb and usm files is in progress.
- Working on an option to change the location of the mods folder, currently defaults to the root of the game folder
- Possibility of using loose files instead of Asset Bundles
