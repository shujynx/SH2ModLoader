# SH2ModLoader
A Mod Loader for Soul Hackers 2, made using [BepInEx](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx).
## Features
- Ability to load modified asset bundles from a `mods` directory instead of directly modifying the original ones
- Log which asset bundles are being accessed at any specific time
## How to install
Follow the guide [DeathChaos](https://gamebanana.com/members/1694106) made over on the [DLC Costumes outside of battle gamebanana page](https://gamebanana.com/mods/398555).
## Known Issues / To-Dos
- Currently the Mod Loader only supports loading modified Asset Bundles, work on being able to load modified acb/awb and usm files is in progress.
- Working on an option to change the location of the mods folder, currently defaults to the root of the game folder
- Possibility of using loose files instead of Asset Bundles
